            <h1>Buy Garlic Bread with Garlicoin!</h1>
            <p>It is typically made using a French baguette, or sometimes a sourdough like ciabatta which is partially sliced
                downwards, allowing the condiments to soak into the loaf while keeping it in one piece. The bread is then
                stuffed through the cuts with oil and minced garlic before baking. Alternatively, butter and garlic powder
                are used, or the bread is cut lengthwise into separate slices which are individually garnished.</p>
            <p>Note: the sell of Garlic Bread hasn't started yet, it will launch when Garlicoin will launch.</p>

                    <h2>Garlic Butter</h2>
                    <p>Garlic butter, also known as beurre à la bourguignonne, is a compound butter used as a flavouring for
                        Escargots à la bourguignonne. It is also spread on bread or used in shrimp scampi. It is composed
                        of butter and garlic pounded into a paste. These ingredients are well blended and chilled before
                        use.</p>
